Hello everyone, I decided to NOT use the IDE 'Eclipse' for this class even though my prior experience
is in Eclipse when I am writing Java code. Eclipse was a standard as a GCU student and there was really no other
options to chose from(really it was just lack of exposure). I have had experience with other IDE's before
but for what I am trying to build and for this class, IntelliJ(JetBrains) has an easier UI and is way easier to navigate in my experience.
I am building some front-end projects using HTML,CSS AND JS it JetBrains functionality for something other than just Java
is what really seemed intruiging to me. You add in GitHub Desktop paired with this work flow and everything seems a lot more intuitive.

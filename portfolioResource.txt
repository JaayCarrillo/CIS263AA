We can use GitHub for a portfolion to help land us a job with a future employer is through Git Pages you can
build a portfolio that you can host on GitHub's platform and showcase your ability to program and the languages
you are familiar with writing code with. In my opinion you can use Git/GitHub in a lot of ways if you can write
some standard Markdown you can work on using MD to customize your GitHub page and add icons to a README file that
showcases in a more designer friendly format of who you are, where you are from , projects that you are working on
and any new updates on projects or assignments that you have going on. What this does is put all of your work in one
area for employers to look at and show proof that you know how to contribute to projects and push new commits.

Hello everyone, I chose this IDE for a lot of reasons but primarily it was because I was ready for a change
from Eclipse. I have done most of my software development school work on Eclipse at GCU since that is their standard
and I found it to be dated. Although, I have to say Eclipse is a powerful and most widely used for Java programming
IntelliJ seemed to be more of the 'modern' IDE to use in the industry. I like its UI and to commit to GitHub was easier for me to do
and keep up with my workflow. Overall, it helps me stay focused on the things that need to stayed focused and I can keep track of my work more fairly.
